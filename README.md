# AI to 3D Modeling & Printing

Exploration of creating 3D printable models using **AI-generated images** as design inspiration.  
Images were generated with tools like **ComfyUI / Hunyuan / Stable Diffusion**, then converted to 3D using **Sparc3D**, refined in **Fusion 360 / 3ds Max**, and printed with the **Bambu Lab P1S**.

### üß† Workflow
1. Generate concept images with AI (ComfyUI + Hunyuan model)  
2. Convert images into 3D models using **Sparc3D**  
3. Clean up geometry and scale for printing  
4. Slice and print using **Bambu Studio**

Example:
Creating a figure using Chatgpt,
promth: "A scary ghost with teeth, flat white background, 1024x1024"
